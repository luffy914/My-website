            <p>Photosynthesis is the essential biological process by which green plants, algae, and certain bacteria
                convert
                light energy into chemical energy, creating glucose and oxygen from
                sunlight,
                water , and carbon dioxide. Occurring primarily in chloroplasts, this two-stage
                process
                (light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle) powers nearly all ecosystems on Earth.</p>

                        <p>Trees and plants are essential for life on Earth, acting as the primary producers of oxygen,
                            absorbers of
                            carbon dioxide (fighting climate change), and air purifiers that remove pollutants. They
                            maintain ecological
                            balance by stabilizing soil to prevent erosion, supporting biodiversity by providing
                            habitats,
                            regulating
                            the water cycle, and providing essential resources like food, medicine, and timber.</p>
                        <li>Environmental Protection: Trees filter air pollution, reduce the heat island effect in
                            cities,
                            and
                            prevent soil erosion through their roots.</li>
                        <li>Climate Regulation: They help mitigate climate change by storing carbon, contributing to the
                            global
                            carbon cycle.Through photosynthesis, they convert carbon dioxide into the oxygen required
                            for
                            survival.

                        <li>Biodiversity & Habitat: Forests support over 80% of terrestrial biodiversity, providing
                            homes
                            for

                        <li>Human Health & Resources: They provide shade, reduce stress, and offer vital resources,
                            including food,
                            medicine, and materials.</li>
